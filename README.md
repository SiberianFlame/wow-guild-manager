# wow-guild-manager

A project that is a handy guild schedule manager in the multiplayer game World of Warcraft. Make event announcements, raid schedules and training events. Your guild members can easily sign up for any of the events and organize their schedules. With this tool, the efficiency of your in-game activities will increase significantly!

Please note: **this project is not finished**. I am currently in active development, but at the moment it is not possible to make full use of the project. Thank you for your understanding.
